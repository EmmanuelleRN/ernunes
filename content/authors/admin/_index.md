I'm a Senior Data Scientist at Microsoft. I currently work with Xbox games data. I’m the creator of <span style="color:purple"> RLadies </span> chapter in Reading, and I’m a certified The Carpentries Instructor.

I love sharing knowledge; this being why I decided to create this blog. Here I hope to share about courses I'm taking and explain concepts for a broader audience. I hope you can enjoy my space and contact me if needed.
