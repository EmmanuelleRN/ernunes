It’s been a while since I created this blog, but I haven’t figured out what to write and what to share here, but I want to make it a habit of putting my mind and thoughts into words.

My idea is to write about Statistics, Machine Learning and anything that I learn about and that I believe is important to share. This will help me learn by putting thoughts into what I hope will be a meaningful project for me, and, with luck, I will help someone else navigate this world of data and numbers that I find incredibly fascinating.

I hope that, whoever you are, you can find meaning in this, and I hope you can achieve your objects! I’m delighted that I can be a part of your journey.

I'll be making use of R and Python to help with the understanding of the theory by applying it in some examples.
