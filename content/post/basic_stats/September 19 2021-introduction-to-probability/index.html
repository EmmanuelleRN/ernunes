<p>For any two events A and B, with <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}(B) &gt; 0\)</span>, we define the conditional probability of A given B (<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}(A|B)\)</span>) as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> We throw a dice once, and it lands on an even number. What is the probability of this number is 2?</p>
<p>We can define A as “dice shows number 2”, and B as “dice result is even”, we have then that A = {2}, B = {2, 4, 6} and <span class="math inline">\(A \cap B = {2}\)</span>, then</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)} = \frac{1}{3}\]</span></p>
