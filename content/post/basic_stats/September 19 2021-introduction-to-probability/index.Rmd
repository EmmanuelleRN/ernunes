For any two events A and B, with $\mathbb{P}(B) > 0$, we define the conditional probability of A given B ($\mathbb{P}(A|B)$) as

$$\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}$$

**Example:** We throw a dice once, and it lands on an even number. What is the probability of this number is 2?

We can define A as "dice shows number 2", and B as "dice result is even", we have then that A = {2}, B = {2, 4, 6} and $A \cap B = {2}$, then

$$\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)} = \frac{1}{3}$$
