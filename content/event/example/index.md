abstract: In their paper, OpenAI explores the use of Evolution Strategies (ES) algorithms as an alternative to Reinforcement Learning techniques claiming that one of this techniqueâ€™s key differentiators is its scalability. I aim to compare both approaches, and I conducted experiments using the OpenAI technique, which were found to display quick learning behaviour if provided with sufficient compute resources.
